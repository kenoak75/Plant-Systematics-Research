    <h1>Plant Systematics Research</h1>

    <p>In the molecular systematics lab at the Huntington Botanical Gardens, we investigate fundamental processes of plant evolution using cutting edge methods combined with traditional field work and the rich Huntington Gardens collections. Systematics research is the understanding and documenting of biological diversity and the processes that produce it. Our current focus is on speciation, phylogeography, phylogenetics, and biogeography in the cycad genus <em>Dioon</em>.</p>

    <p><em>Dioon</em> is one of ten living genera of cycads, with fifteen species mostly endemic to Mexico and one in Honduras. While they may resemble palm trees, they are actually gymnosperms – they make seeds but not flowers – and are relatives of Gingkos and pines. Cycads are generally found in tropical to subtropical habitats. The species of <em>Dioon</em> can be found across all of the major mountain systems of Mexico but the center of diversity for this genus is in southern Mexico. Populations range from several hundred to only a few dozen individuals and most species are considered vulnerable or endangered – hence their protected status. Species are distinguished by relatively subtle characters with many having striking similarities. This suggests some interesting possibilities for their evolutionary history, including recent divergence from a common ancestor and/or hybridization between species.</p>

    <h1>Evolutionary History</h1>

    <p>The main goal of our research is to reconstruct the evolutionary history and genetic diversity of these species to better understand the processes that have led to their diversity and distribution. We also aim to inform conservation efforts both in Mexico and at institutions such as the Huntington.</p>

    <p>Questions we hope to answer:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>What are the evolutionary relationships among species?</li>
        <li>What has driven speciation in this group?</li>
        <li>What are the true species boundaries in <em>Dioon</em>?</li>
        <li>What is the genetic diversity of populations and how isolated are they from each other?</li>
        <li>What is the timing of divergence and any hybridization events among species?</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>DNA Sequence Data</h1>

    <p>The Huntington Gardens are an invaluable resource for botanical research as they provide specimens and material of species from around the world. To test hypotheses that may answer our questions we use DNA sequence data produced in the lab and morphological data collected in the field. Because informative regions of the <em>Dioon</em> genome have been elusive, we have developed our own set of “genetic markers” from plant DNA in the Huntington collection using transcriptomics and next-generation sequencing technology. In doing so we, along with collaborators at UC Berkeley, have compiled the first genomic data sets for <em>Dioon</em> and are using them to look back in time at the evolutionary history of these species. By reconstructing the timing of diversification in <em>Dioon</em> we can test whether processes such as climate change may have been involved in the speciation events that ultimately produced the living species of today.</p>

    <h1>Student Involvement</h1>

    <p>At the Huntington’s systematics lab, we value the participation of interns, volunteers, and students in our research. Students from Pasadena City College work in a range of capacities, from performing basic molecular techniques, such as DNA extraction, to curating collections, to leading research projects into molecular markers of sex in cycads.</p>
